# Gianluca Veschi Blog (Jekyll)

## Run locally

From this repo root:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.

## Writing posts

Create files in `_posts/` named like:

`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

## Notion (later)

You can export pages from Notion as Markdown and place them into `_posts/`.
We'll add an importer script later to automate this.
